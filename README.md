## Business Strategy Recommendations  

1. **Enhance Online Platform**: In the upcoming quarter, the business should adopt a new strategy aimed at enhancing its online platform to capitalize on its growing potential. The focus will be on customers aged 60 and above, who currently account for 44.1% of total revenues, especially in the US and Canada. This strategy involves redesigning the user interface of the online platform to present product content in a more concise and organized manner, prioritizing key information for easier navigation.
2. **Focus on High-Ticket Items**: Continue to promote and expand the desktop PC and LCD HDTV product lines, as these are significant profit drivers. Introducing new models or features that align with consumer preferences will help sustain growth in these segments.
3. **Enhance Marketing for Low-Ticket Items**: Invest in targeted marketing strategies to boost sales in low-ticket categories, such as games and toys. Consider implementing promotional campaigns, bundling products, or offering seasonal discounts to attract customers and increase sales volume.
4. **Geographic Market Expansion**: Explore opportunities to strengthen your presence in lower-performing markets, particularly in Italy. Tailoring marketing strategies to local preferences and considering strategic partnerships can enhance brand visibility and drive sales.
5. **Invest in Customer Retention Strategies**: Given the significant decline in retention rates since 2020, develop engagement strategies such as personalized email campaigns and exclusive offers. These initiatives can enhance customer loyalty and improve retention rates.
